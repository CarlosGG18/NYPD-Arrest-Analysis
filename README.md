# Overview 

With New York City being one of the most densely populated cities in the world, the aim of this project is to analyze and gain insights from the NYPD arrest dataset from 2020 to March 2024. By examining this data, I hope to uncover patterns and trends that will provide a better understanding of how the criminal justice system operates in the city, areas of interest, how recent policy changes influence arrest rates, and build a predictive model to identify points of interest. 

# Dataset

The primary dataset I am utilizing is the [NYPD Arrest Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc/about_data)
, which contains information on arrests made by the NYPD, including details such as arrest date, offense description, borough, law category, demographic information of the arrestee, and longitude & latitude of the arrest. I incorportaed both the 2024 year-to-date arrest data as well as the historical arrest dataset but only used arrests made after 2020 which can be found within the cleaning.ipynb notebook.

# Problem Statement

Crime analysis plays a crucial role in maintaining law and order in any community. By identifying patterns of crime, law enforcement agencies can effectively plan crime prevention programs. The goal of crime data analysis is to support police operations, such as criminal investigations, apprehensions, prosecutions, and the development of crime prevention strategies.
